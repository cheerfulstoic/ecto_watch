* Support features of `CREATE TRIGGER`:
  * allow specifying a condition for when the trigger should fire
* Allow watchers to support adapter pattern.  Potential adapters:
  * Phoenix PubSub (the default, would work like it does now)
  * GenStage producer
  * Creating a batch-processing GenServer to reduce queries to the database.
* Allow for local broadcasting of Phoenix.PubSub messages
